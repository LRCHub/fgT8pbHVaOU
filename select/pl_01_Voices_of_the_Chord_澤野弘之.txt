Hunger for the sleep
I know will never come
Crowded is the space
but don’t have anyone
I could read the Bible
to drown out the hum
Avoid the voices of the Chord
All the roads inside
my head loop back to you
I’ve done many things
I’d thought I’d never do
It’s you that I can feel
But I keep my hands
Upon the wheel
I turn the page to drown you out
You are the only thing
that I still care about
If I can heal the conflict
that’s within
I’ll know the war has reached
its bitter end
Ocean you are calling me
A place with no memory
You’ll see!
I burned the Blood
I passed the test
And now my love is laid to rest
Our names aren’t written
on the list
I turn the page to drown you out
You are the only thing
that I still care about
If I can heal the conflict
that’s within
I’ll know the war has reached
its bitter end
Ocean you are calling me
A place with no memory
You’ll see!
I burned the blood
I passed the test
And now my love is laid to rest
Our names aren’t written
on the list
But you and I know we exist
